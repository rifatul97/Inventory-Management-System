# Inventory Management V1.0

This Inventory application allows the user to store data, modify and display them
conveniently with minimalist design. Two different ways data can be stored are named as parts
and products. A part is an individual component that has two different types - in-house and
outsourced, while the product can hold associated parts that can exist independent of current
inventory of parts.
